This was a long-lasting project that involved two writers (including me) and resulted in over 30 web pages detailing service offerings of a global IT outsourcing/software development vendor.

My task was to grasp where the market is headed out to regarding a specific service/technology/domain, stack up the related expertise accumulated within the companyâ€™s divisions, and juxtapose the two to craft a precise, persuasive market offering. I also collaborated closely with UI designers, providing them with raw wireframes and brainstorming on the page layout.

**Release year:** 2016.

Among the pages that have been left as is since 2016:

* **Dedicated Development Centers:** [iflexion.com/services/dedicated-development-team](https://www.iflexion.com/services/dedicated-development-team)

* **Mobile App Development Service:** [iflexion.com/services/mobile-application-development](https://www.iflexion.com/services/mobile-application-development)
